## What is a Programming Language?

A programming language is a formal set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. These instructions follow a specific syntax and rules so that the computer can interpret and execute them.

## 1. What is a Programming Language?

A programming language is a formal set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. These instructions follow a specific syntax and rules so that the computer can interpret and execute them.

### Layman Terms

* Computers do not understand human language directly; they understand binary (0s and 1s).


* Programming languages bridge this gap by allowing humans to write code in a readable format, which is then translated into machine code.



### The Taxi Analogy

Think of a programming language like giving directions to a taxi driver:

* You tell the driver step-by-step where to go (code/instructions).


* The driver (computer) follows exactly what you say.


* If your directions are clear, you reach the right place (desired output).


* If your directions are wrong or incomplete, the driver might take you somewhere else (errors or wrong output).

## 2. What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

* It is like learning a new language but easier than English grammar.


* It lets computers understand your instructions.



### History of Python

* 
**Creator:** Guido van Rossum.


* 
**Release Year:** 1991.


* 
**Name Origin:** Named after the "Monty Python" comedy show.


* 
**Status:** Now the world’s #1 used programming language.

## 5. Installation Guide

### Step 1: Download Python

1. Go to the official website: `https://www.python.org/`.


2. Hover over "Downloads".


3. Choose your operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux).


4. Download the latest Stable Release (e.g., Python 3.x.x).


5. 
**Important:** Always check "Add Python to PATH" during installation (important for running Python from the command line).



### Step 2: Install Python (Windows Example)

1. Open the downloaded installer.


2. Tick **"Add Python to PATH"**.


3. Click "Install Now".


4. Once installed, open Command Prompt and type the following to verify the version:


```bash
python --version

```



### Step 3: VS Code Setup

Install the following required extensions in VS Code:

* Python Extension by Microsoft.
* Jupyter Extension.
* Code Runner (Optional).

## 7. Assignment for Students

1. Install Python.


2. Install VS Code.


3. Run 3 print programs.


4. Take a screenshot of the VS Code window.tand human language directly; they understand binary (0s and 1s). Programming languages bridge this gap by allowing humans to write code in a readable format, which is then translated into machine code.
